If bounce rates were high on important pages, or conversion rates were much higher on some pages than others, try to use the data available to you to gain valuable insights into why this is happening and leverage it to ensure future success.</p>
<p><strong>What is your competition doing?</strong><br> Monitoring your competition’s online presence will allow you to see what is and isn’t working well in your competitive landscape and gain key insights into how to craft your own strategy. What are some things you like about your competitors’ websites or how they are leveraging social media? Are their opportunities they are missing out on or important things not included on their website?</p>
<p><strong>Who are the buyers of your products/services?</strong>&nbsp;<br> Take identifying the traditional “target audience” of your business to the next level. Who are the people actually buying your products or services? Having brand advocates and people who are interested in your business is great. However, for an e-commerce business typically around 97% of the traffic doesn’t convert. Identifying the demographics and understanding the behavior of your buyers now will help ensure your digital strategy better aligns with this valuable segment of your target audience and increases conversion rates.</p>
<p><strong>What are the best channels and mediums to engage and connect with this audience?</strong><br> A digital strategy combines the use of many different channels and mediums to engage with customers on the web. This can include the use of a digital platform, paid search marketing, and social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) &nbsp;Once you identify your customers, try to identify what channels and mediums they are using to make their purchases. Additionally, knowing which social media channels your buyers are using will help to hone in on an effective overall strategy.</p>
<p><strong>What are your key differentiators to help make your business and website stand out from competitors in the industry?</strong><br> What makes your business different and why should customers choose you over someone else? Information about your competitors is just a few clicks away on the internet. Once you have the attention of your potential customers, be sure these messages are clear throughout your online presence. Identifying these early on in the process will help craft and articulate the story you are telling online.</p>
<p><strong>What is the “voice” and “personality” of your brand?</strong><br> The tone and voice of your online messaging needs to be consistent throughout and match the personality of your brand. In the digital space, first impressions are important and it is vital that the way the content is written and presented is in line with what your customers expect.</p>
<p><strong>What devices are potential customers using to find information and make purchases online?</strong><br> Mobile devices account for nearly 30% of all online traffic now, and this is expected to continue to grow. Knowing what kind of devices your customers are using and how they are using them is an important aspect in crafting a digital strategy. Ensuring that you have a strong user experiences through responsively designed websites and mobile-friendly strategies are crucial to not missing out on this 30% of traffic.</p>
<p><strong>What is your business capable of handling internally?</strong><br> Taking on the planning and implementation of a digital strategy is no small task. It can involve designing and developing a new website that meets today’s ever-changing standards, creating the content and copy for new web pages, creating and optimizing a paid search campaign, and managing interactions and engagements across the whole realm of social media. It is important to understand how much work might be involved before getting in over your head. Is this something that your company is capable of handling internally, or does it make sense to work with experts with proven success in the digital marketing space?</p>
